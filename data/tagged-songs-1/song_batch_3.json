He, stepping down\r\nBy zig-zag paths, and juts of pointed rock,\r\nCame on the shining levels of the lake.\r\nThere drew he forth the brand Excalibur,\r\nAnd o\u0026#x27;er him, drawing it, the winter moon,\r\nBrightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth\r\nAnd sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:\r\nFor all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,\r\nMyriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work\r\nOf subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long\r\nThat both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood,\r\nThis way and that dividing the swift mind,\r\nIn act to throw: but at the last it seem\u0026#x27;d\r\nBetter to leave Excalibur conceal\u0026#x27;d\r\nThere in the many-knotted waterflags,\r\nThat whistled stiff and dry about the marge.\r\nSo strode he back slow to the wounded king.\r\nThen spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:\r\n\u0026quot;Hast thou perform\u0026#x27;d my mission which I gave?\r\nWhat is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?\u0026quot;\r\nAnd answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:\r\n\u0026quot;I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,\r\nAnd the wild water lapping on the crag.\u0026quot;\r\nTo whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:\r\n\u0026quot;Thou hast betray\u0026#x27;d thy nature and thy name,\r\nNot rendering true answer, as beseem\u0026#x27;d\r\nThy f\u00EBalty, nor like a noble knight:\r\nFor surer sign had follow\u0026#x27;d, either hand,\r\nOr voice, or else a motion of the mere.\r\nThis is a shameful thing for men to lie.\r\nYet now, I charge thee, quickly go again\r\nAs thou art lief and dear, and do the thing\r\nI bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word.\u0026quot;\r\nThen went Sir Bedivere the second time\r\nAcross the ridge, and paced beside the mere,\r\nCounting the dewy pebbles, fix\u0026#x27;d in thought;\r\nBut when he saw the wonder of the hilt,\r\nHow curiously and strangely chased, he smote\r\nHis palms together, and he cried aloud,\r\n\u0026quot;And if indeed I cast the brand away,\r\nSurely a precious thing, one worthy note,\r\nShould thus be lost for ever from the earth,\r\nWhich might have pleased the eyes of many men.\r\nWhat good should follow this, if this were done?\r\nWhat harm, undone? deep harm to disobey,\r\nSeeing obedience is the bond of rule,\r\nWere it well to obey then, if a king demand\r\nAn act unprofitable against himself?\r\nThe king is sick, and knows not what he does.\r\nWhat record, or what relic of my lord\r\nShould be to aftertime, but empty breath\r\nAnd rumours of a doubt? but were this kept,\r\nStored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,\r\nSome one might show it at a joust of arms,\r\nSaying, \u0026#x27;King Arthur\u0026#x27;s sword, Excalibur,\r\nWrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.\r\nNine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps\r\nUpon the hidden bases of the hills.\u0026quot;\r\nSo might some old man speak in the aftertime\r\nTo all the people, winning reverence.\r\nBut now much honour and much fame were lost.\u0026quot;\r\nSo spake he, clouded with his own conceit,\r\nAnd hid Excalibur the second time,\r\nAnd so strode back slow to the wounded King.\r\nThen spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:\r\n\u0026quot;What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?\u0026quot;\r\nAnd answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:\r\n\u0026quot;I heard the water lapping on the crag,\r\nAnd the long ripple washing in the reeds.\u0026quot;\r\nTo whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:\r\n\u0026quot;Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,\r\nUnknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!\r\nAuthority forgets a dying king,\r\nLaid widow\u0026#x27;d of the power in his eye\r\nThat bow\u0026#x27;d the will. I see thee what thou art,\r\nFor thou, the latest-left of all my knights,\r\nIn whom should meet the offices of all,\r\nThou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;\r\nEither from lust of gold, or like a girl\r\nValuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.\r\nYet, for a man may fail in duty twice,\r\nAnd the third time may prosper, get thee hence:\r\nBut, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,\r\nI will arise and slay thee with my hands.\u0026quot;\r\nThen quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,  1\r\nAnd, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged\r\nAmong the bulrush-beds, and clutch\u0026#x27;d the sword,\r\nAnd strongly wheel\u0026#x27;d and threw it. The great brand\r\nMade lightnings in the splendour of the moon,\r\nAnd flashing round and round, and whirl\u0026#x27;d in an arch,\r\nShot like a streamer of the northern morn,\r\nSeen where the moving isles of winter shock\r\nBy night, with noises of the northern sea.\r\nSo flash\u0026#x27;d and fell the brand Excalibur:\r\nBut ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm\r\nClothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,\r\nAnd caught him by the hilt, and brandish\u0026#x27;d him\r\nThree times, and drew him under in the mere.\r\nAnd lightly went the other to the King.\r\nThen spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:\r\n\u0026#x27;Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.\r\nSpeak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?\u0026quot;\r\nAnd answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:\r\n\u0026quot;Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems\r\nShould blind my purpose, for I never saw,\r\nNor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,\r\nNot tho\u0026#x27; I live three lives of mortal men,\r\nSo great a miracle as yonder hilt.\r\nThen with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;\r\nBut when I look\u0026#x27;d again, behold an arm,\r\nClothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,\r\nThat caught him by the hilt, and brandish\u0026#x27;d him\r\nThree times, and drew him under in the mere.\u0026quot;\r\nAnd answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:\r\n\u0026quot;My end draws nigh;\u0026#x27;tis time that I were gone.\r\nMake broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,\r\nAnd bear me to the margin; yet I fear\r\nMy wound hath taken cold, and I shall die.\u0026quot;\r\nSo saying, from the pavement he hath rose,\r\nSlowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,\r\nAnd looking wistfully with wide blue eyes\r\nAs in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere\r\nRemorsefully regarded thro\u0026#x27; his tears,\r\nAnd would have spoken, but he found not words,\r\nThen took with care, and kneeling on one knee,\r\nO\u0026#x27;er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,\r\nAnd rising bore him thro\u0026#x27; the place of tombs.\r\nBut, as he walk\u0026#x27;d, King Arthur panted hard,\r\nLike one that feels a nightmare on his bed\r\nWhen all the house is mute. So sigh\u0026#x27;d the King,\r\nMuttering and murmuring at his ear\u0026quot;\r\nQuick, quick! I fear it is too late, and I shall die \u0026quot;.\r\nBut the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,\r\nClothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk\u0026#x27;d,\r\nLarger than human on the frozen hills.\r\nHe heard the deep behind him, and a cry\r\nBefore. His own thought drove him like a goad.\r\nDry clash\u0026#x27;d his harness in the icy caves\r\nAnd barren chasms, and all to left and right\r\nThe bare black cliff clang\u0026#x27;d round him, as he based\r\nHis feet on juts of slippery crag that rang\r\nSharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels \u00AD\r\nAnd on a sudden, lo! the level lake,\r\nAnd the long glories of the winter moon.\r\nThen saw they how there hove a dusky barge,\r\nDark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,\r\nBeneath them; and descending they were ware\r\nThat all the decks were dense with stately forms\r\nBlack-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream \u00AD by these\r\nThree Queens with crowns of gold \u00AD and from them rose\r\nA cry that shiver\u0026#x27;d to the tingling stars,\r\nAnd, as it were one voice, an agony\r\nOf lamentation, like a wind, that shrills\r\nAll night in a waste land, where no one comes,\r\nOr hath come, since the making of the world.\r\nThen murmur\u0026#x27;d Arthur, \u0026quot;Place me in the barge,\u0026quot;\r\nAnd to the barge they came. There those three Queens\r\nPut forth their hands, and took the King, and wept.\r\nBut she, that rose the tallest of them all\r\nAnd fairest, laid his head upon her lap,\r\nAnd loosed the shatter\u0026#x27;d casque, and chafed his hands,\r\nAnd call\u0026#x27;d him by his name, complaining loud,\r\nAnd dropping bitter tears against his brow\r\nStriped with dark blood: for all his face was white\r\nAnd colourless, and like the wither\u0026#x27;d moon\r\nSmote by the fresh beam of the springing east;\r\nAnd all his greaves and cuisses dash\u0026#x27;d with drops\r\nOf onset; and the light and lustrous curls \u00AD\r\nThat made his forehead like a rising sun\r\nHigh from the d\u00E4is-throne \u00AD were parch\u0026#x27;d with dust;\r\nOr, clotted into points and hanging loose,\r\nMix\u0026#x27;d with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.\r\nSo like a shatter\u0026#x27;d column lay the King;\r\nNot like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,\r\nFrom spur to plume a star of tournament,\r\nShot thro\u0026#x27; the lists at Camelot, and charged\r\nBefore the eyes of ladies and of kings.\r\nThen loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere,\r\n\u0026quot;Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?\r\nWhere shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?\r\nFor now I see the true old times are dead,\r\nWhen every morning brought a noble chance,\r\nAnd every chance brought out a noble knight.\r\nSuch times have been not since the light that led\r\nThe holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.\r\nBut now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved\r\nWhich was an image of the mighty world;\r\nAnd I, the last, go forth companionless.\r\nAnd the days darken round me, and the years,\r\nAmong new men, strange faces, other minds.\u0026quot;\r\nAnd slowly answer\u0026#x27;d Arthur from the barge:\r\n\u0026quot;The old order changeth, yielding place to new,\r\nAnd God fulfils Himself in many ways,\r\nLest one good custom should corrupt the world.\r\nComfort thyself: what comfort is in me?\r\nI have lived my life, and that which I have done\r\nMay He within Himself make pure! but thou,\r\nIf thou shouldst never see my face again,\r\nPray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer\r\nThan this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice\r\nRise like a fountain for me night and day.\r\nFor what are men better than sheep or goats\r\nThat nourish a blind life within the brain,\r\nIf, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer\r\nBoth for themselves and those who call them friend?\r\nFor so the whole round earth is every way\r\nBound by gold chains  about the feet of God.\r\nBut now farewell. I am going a long way\r\nWith these thou se\u00EBst \u00AD if indeed I go \u00AD\r\n(For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)\r\nTo the island-valley of Avilion;\r\nWhere falls not hail, or rain,  or any snow,\r\nNor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies\r\nDeep-meadow\u0026#x27;d, happy, fair with orchard-lawns\r\nAnd bowery hollows crown\u0026#x27;d with summer sea,\r\nWhere I will heal me of my grievous wound.\u0026quot;\r\nSo said he, and the barge with oar and sail\r\nMoved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan\r\nThat, fluting a wild carol ere her death,\r\nRuffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood\r\nWith swarthy webs.
