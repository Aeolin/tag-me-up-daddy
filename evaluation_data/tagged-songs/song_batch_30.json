I come up with my best ideas when I\u0026#x27;m like truly alone, and I think that\u0026#x27;s sort of why I fell in love with songwriting. I\u0026#x27;ve always been a super emotional, I\u0026#x27;ve always felt things really deeply, so writing has really been a way for me to sort of process those emotions, and make them a little less confusing. Things become so much clearer when you write them down, become so much more manageable when you can sort of look at them on a paper, or hear it in a song. Cr\u0435ating SOUR was exactly that experi\u0435nce. I really used it as a way to process so many uncomfortable emotions and so many emotions that aren\u0026#x27;t really publicly fun or acceptable to express; jealousy and anger and like spite, and I think there wouldn\u0026#x27;t be no way for me to like express that any other way except for songwriting\r\n\r\nMaking music has really taught me how to have confidence in my point of view and my choices. \u0026quot;drivers license\u0026quot; is such a my heart on a silver platter song, and all of my favourite artist said this, \u0026quot;once you make a song, you have to sort of disassociate yourself from it, and be like \u0026#x27;okay, it\u0026#x27;s the world\u0026#x27;s now, and the world can project whatever they want to on it, and the only thing you can do is write a song that resonates with you.\u0026#x27;\u0026quot; I am never gonna sacrifice writing truthful, authentic, personal songs for fear of what a couple people on the internet are gonna say\r\n\r\n[Sung]\r\n(Do you get d\u00E9j\u00E0 vu, huh?)\r\n\r\n[Spoken]\r\nI\u0026#x27;m so not the girl that I was when I wrote SOUR.
