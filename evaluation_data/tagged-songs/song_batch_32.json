each Thursday afternoon\r\nThey talk about life and love and phases of the moon\r\nShe lets the girl try on her gown she\u0026#x27;s kept for all these years\r\nShe talks about when she was young, her

they all look so debonair\r\nShe remembers all the faces and the night each one proposed\r\nIt makes her feel so young again as her old eyes slowly close\r\n\r\nThe papers never said much when the old maid passed away\r\nFor the man who drove the moving-van it was just another day\r\nThe florist never understood when the young girl left the store\r\nJust why she sent a wreath that said from the

(Live)","Lyrics":"When I woke today, felt another way\r\nEverything was gonna be fine\r\nWhen my head rose up then my legs came too\r\nQuarter past nine was the time\r\nWell I used to lose floating memories, found myself wishing I\u0026#x27;d remember old times\r\nBut I woke today\r\nFelt another way\r\nI\u0026#x27;m free in my mind to fly\r\nHey, Hey\r\nI stepped out the door, I didn\u0026#x27;t know what for\r\nI saw the lady walking along\r\nWell I could have cried out what I wanted to say\r\nBut I am sick of all this terrible charm\r\nWell I used to be into apologies, a regular to shame I was shy\r\nBut I woke today\r\nI felt another way\r\nI\u0026#x27;m free in my mind to fly\r\nWell I\u0026#x27;m through the gate, I got to my house about a quarter to eight\r\nAnd I made a drink, I got about an hour to relax and just think\r\nI\u0026#x27;m just bored, nothing\u0026#x27;s ever gonna be the same anymore\r\nWith my drink in hand up to stand and I was off to a regular day\r\nWith my drink in hand I got up to stand and I waas off to a regular dayayay\r\nThe morning dragged on, I was walking along\r\nMissing pieces fell to the ground\r\nApparently, I could not see\r\nBut I saw everything going down\r\nSo I packed my bags and I was on my way\r\nI feel a little different in a different way\r\nBut like I said when I got out of my bed, I was off to a regular day\r\nI could not hide, I wore my pride\r\nIt felt good to be on the run\r\nThe air quality is something new to me and I got along fine with that sun\r\nAnd when I rest my head and I lay down to my bed\r\nPut the pieces down with the blame\r\nAnd then if all goes well, at the morning bell\r\nI\u0026#x27;ll be feeling free just the same\r\nWell I\u0026#x27;m through the gate, got to my house about a quarter to eight\r\nAnd I made a drink, I gotta bout an hour to relax and just think\r\nI\u0026#x27;m just bored, nothing\u0026#x27;s ever gonna be the same anymore\r\nAnd with my drink in hand I\u0026#x27;m up to stand and I was off to a regular day\r\nAnd with my drink in hand I got up to stand and I was off to a regular dayayay\r\nI thought I told you a thousand times before, but you come knock knock knock knockin at my door\r\nI don\u0026#x27;t need you around I need my soul, but you been takin me out my mind\r\nAnd I don\u0026#x27;t want it back don\u0026#x27;t need it back just pack up your shit and get gone\r\nAnd don\u0026#x27;t let the door go and slam you in the thang when you get up and your on\r\nAnd I, I\u0026#x27;ve got to tell you today\r\nThat I am so moved on in every single way,and if I could drink from the water again I would turn it down\r\nBecause the fountain is full when I want it to be and I don\u0026#x27;t need it anymore you see\r\nSo get it together and get gone baby because I I I I I\u0026#x27;m so moved on\r\nI am so moved on so moved on i\u0026#x27;ve got my things and I\u0026#x27;m gone\r\nI am so moved on so moved on I\u0026#x27;m

french but I sell a child\r\nAnd that was the day I told her I need more time\r\n\r\n[Verse 2]\r\nBut I did that walking when she was still talking\r\nAnd I\u2019m looking for an exit sign\r\nPardon my face but I\u2019m leaving no trace because I really haven\u2019t got no more time\r\nI began thinking and my heart is sinking and I\u2019m looking for a place to go\r\nWell isn\u2019t it sad she could treat you so bad you never really let her know\r\nEveryone said she crying but I can\u2019t forget the time I was trying\r\nAnd that was the day I told her I need more time\r\nI know I know but what it feels like to be alone\r\nI say now I know I know what it feels like to be at home\r\nI know I like I like stopping to say hello\r\nSo my life my life why can\u2019t we take this slow why can\u2019t you take this slow\r\nGo Richard\r\n\r\n[Verse 3]\r\nWhy can\u2019t we take this slow\r\nWell I think that your fazes I\u2019m walking through your mazes\r\nI\u2019m so damn sick I\u2019m so tired\r\nIt sure isn\u2019t fair but I was never aware of the patience that you require\r\nNo fight but I kissed you everytime that I missed you I still would\u2019ve walked out that door\r\nCause now and again I could sure use a friend isn\u2019t that what you\u2019re for\r\nAnd everyone say that I\u2019m lying but I can\u2019t forget the time that I was trying\r\nAnd that was the day I told her I need more time\r\nI know I know but what it feels like to be alone\r\nI say now I know I know what it feels like to be at home\r\nI know I like I like stopping to say hello\r\nSo my life my life why can\u2019t we take this slow why can\u2019t you take this slow\r\nFeels like to be alone so you know\r\nJust what it\u2019s like to live at home do you love do you like\r\nSitting back just seeing my life it\u2019s my only life\r\nWe better take it slow do you know do you know what it feels like to be alone\r\nDo you know do you know what it\u2019s like to be at home\r\nI know I like I like stopping to say hello\r\nSo my life my life why can\u2019t we take this slow why can\u2019t you take this slow\r\nYeah take it
