by\u00A0Air (Ft.\u00A0Alessandro\u00A0Baricco)","Lyrics":"Il secondo giorno, lo sceriffo Wister si sveglia col buio. Ravviva il fuoco, si scalda un caff\u00E8. Aspetta l\u0026#x27;alba. Al primo chiarore, vede Dark, lontano, in piedi, immobile, di fianco al suo baio pezzato. Allora prende il binocolo. Il ragazzo non ha fucile. Sorride. \u0026quot;Forse ha una pistola.\u0026quot; Poi si siede per terra, e dice piano:\r\n\u0026quot;A te la prima mossa, ragazzo.\u0026quot;\r\nSe ne stanno fermi, per ore. Tutto intorno sole, ad arroventare il niente. Lo sceriffo Wister beve un sorso di acqua e uno di whiskey, ogni mezz\u0026#x27;ora. La luce \u00E8 accecante. A un tratto rivede Benjamin che ride e corre\r\n\u0026quot;Crepa, figlio di puttana,\u0026quot; pensa, \u0026quot;crepa, indiano bastardo.\u0026quot;\r\nE allora si alza. Sente la testa girare. Prende le redini in mano e inizia a camminare, tirandosi dietro il cavallo. Cammina piano, ma l\u00E0 davanti Dark non si muove. Non sale a cavallo, non scappa. Duecento metri, forse meno. Lo sceriffo Wister si ferma. Urla:\r\n\u0026quot;Falla finita Dark\u0026quot;. E dice piano: \u0026quot;Fatti ammazzare, da bravo\u0026quot;. E poi ancora, urlando: \u0026quot;Dark, non fare l\u0026#x27;idiota.\u0026quot;\r\nIl ragazzo resta immobile. Wister controlla fucile e pistole. Poi monta in sella. Parte al galoppo. Vede Dark montare a cavallo e scappare. Vanno avanti cos\u00EC, fino a sfiancare i cavalli.\r\nPoi, all\u0026#x27;orizzonte, appare un pueblo, dimenticato nel nulla. Dark lo punta, Wister lo segue. Una decina di minuti e Dark entra al galoppo nel pueblo, e sparisce. Lo sceriffo Wister rallenta e prima di entrare nel paese scende da cavallo. Estrae la pistola e raggiunge le prime case. Non c\u0026#x27;\u00E8 anima viva. Cammina lento lungo i muri, attento al minimo rumore. Spia ogni finestra, legge ogni ombra. Sente il cuore pulsargli nelle orecchie.\r\n\u0026quot;Calma,\u0026quot; pensa. \u0026quot;Probabilmente non \u00E8 nemmeno armato. Devi solo trovarlo e fotterlo. \u00C8 un ragazzo.\u0026quot;\r\nContinua a camminare e alla fine vede una vecchia, in piedi, sulla soglia di una posada. Si avvicina. Le chiede in spagnolo se ha visto un indiano, con un cavallo pezzato. Lei fa cenno di s\u00EC, con la testa, e indica il fondo del villaggio, dove la pista continua nel nulla. Wister le punta la pistola alla testa. \u0026quot;Non mentire,\u0026quot; le dice in spagnolo. Lei si fa un segno di croce, e indica di nuovo la fine del villaggio. Allora lo sceriffo mette via la pistola. \u0026quot;Hai da bere?\u0026quot;, chiede. La donna entra nella posada, poi esce con dell\u0026#x27;acquavite. Lo sceriffo Wister beve.\r\n\u0026quot;Si \u00E8 portato via dell\u0026#x27;acqua, l\u0026#x27;indiano?\u0026quot; La vecchia fa cenno di no. Allora lo sceriffo Wister le chiede \u0026quot;Lo sai chi \u00E8?\u0026quot; E la vecchia dice: \u0026quot;S\u00EC. Es un chico que va detr\u00E1s de un asesino.\u0026quot;\r\nLo sceriffo Wister rimane a fissarla. \u0026quot;Te l\u0026#x27;ha detto lui?\u0026quot;, chiede.\u0026quot; Lei risponde: \u0026quot;S\u00EC.\u0026quot; Lo sceriffo Wister beve un altro sorso di acquavite. \u0026quot;Tu sei morto, ragazzo,\u0026quot; pensa\r\nSale a cavallo, getta una moneta alla vecchia, mette l\u0026#x27;acquavite nella sacca, e prosegue, al passo, verso la fine del paese. Quando supera l\u0026#x27;ultima casa guarda davanti a s\u00E9. Nulla. Ma quando si volta a destra, vede Dark immobile, in sella, a non pi\u00F9 di cento metri. \u0026quot;Es un chico que va detr\u00E1s de un asesino.\u0026quot;\r\nLo sceriffo Wister si passa una mano sul volto. \u0026quot;Calma\u0026quot;, pensa. Rimane a fissare Dark. Vuole urlargli qualcosa, ma non gli viene in mente niente. Volta il cavallo, torna alla prima casa, e smonta. Passa la notte l\u00EC. Ma senza riuscire a dormire. Una pistola, sempre, in mano.","ArtistNames":"Air (Ft.

Gli occhi deglutiti dal cranio, e mani di ulivo, le mani veloci, rami d\u0026#x27;inverno. Stanchi. Il suo pettine, al mattino, bagnato d\u0026#x27;acqua, rigare i capelli bianchi all\u0026#x27;indietro, trasparenti, ormai. Polmoni di tabacco nella voce che piano dice: che vento, oggi.\r\nNiente di peggio che non morire, per un pistolero.\r\nGuardarsi intorno, ogni faccia mai vista pu\u00F2 essere quella dell\u0026#x27;idiota di turno arrivato da lontano per diventare quello che ha ammazzato Clay \u0026quot;Bird\u0026quot; Puller. Se vuoi sapere quando si diventa un mito, allora ascolta: \u00E8 quando ti ritrovi a duellare sempre di schiena. Finch\u00E9 ti vengono incontro da davanti sei solo un pistolero. La gloria \u00E8 una scia di merda, dietro la schiena. - Sbrigati coglione, - gli dissi senza nemmeno voltarmi. Il ragazzetto aveva un cappello nero, e in tasca qualche stronzata che era il ricordo di un odio lontano, e la promessa di una qualche vendetta. - Troppo tardi, coglione.\r\nCon queste strade sulla faccia, vecchiaia vigliacca, a pisciarmi addosso la notte, il male bastardo sotto il cinturone, come una pietra rovente tra la pancia e il culo, non viene mai giorno, e quando viene \u00E8 un deserto di tempo vuoto, da attraversare, come sono arrivato qui?, io.\r\nCome sparava Bird. Teneva le fondine al contrario con il calcio della pistola che usciva in avanti. Estraeva a braccia incrociate, la pistola destra nella mano sinistra, e viceversa. Cos\u00EC, quando ti veniva incontro, le mani a sfiorare le pistole, sembrava una specie di condannato, qualcosa come un prigioniero che stesse andando al patibolo, con le braccia legate davanti. Un istante dopo era un uccello rapace che apriva le ali, una frustata nell\u0026#x27;aria, e il geometrico volo di due pallottole. Bird.\r\nCos\u0026#x27;\u00E8 allora questo strisciare nella nebbia delle mie cataratte, costretto a contare le ore, io che conoscevo gli istanti, ed era l\u0026#x27;unico tempo che esisteva per me. Ci ho vissuto eternit\u00E0, dove gli altri vedevano attimi. Lo scarto di una pupilla, le nocche sbiancate intorno a un bicchiere, uno sperone nel fianco del cavallo, l\u0026#x27;ombra di un\u0026#x27;ombra sul muro blu. Per loro era come un flash ci\u00F2 che per me era una mappa, una stella dove io vedevo il cielo. Io pensavo dentro pieghe del tempo che per loro erano gi\u00E0 un ricordo. Non c\u0026#x27;\u00E8 altro modo, mi avevano insegnato, per vedere la morte prima che arrivi. Cos\u0026#x27;\u00E8 allora questo strisciare nella nebbia delle mie cataratte, costretto a spiare le carte degli altri, mendicando battute dalla mia sedia, sempre quella, in seconda fila, la sera a tirare sassi ai cani, in tasca soldi da vecchio che le puttane non vogliono, li prender\u00E0 un mariachi, quando verr\u00E0, che sia triste e lunga la tua canzone voglio ballare, questa notte, fino al tramonto.\r\nDicevano che Bird si portasse sempre dietro un dizionario. Francese. Ci aveva studiato tutte le parole, una dopo l\u0026#x27;altra, in ordine alfabetico. Era cos vecchio che aveva gi\u00E0 fatto il giro e adesso se ne stava dalle parti della G, per la seconda volta. Nessuno sapeva perch mai facesse tutto quello. Per una volta, a Tandeltown, dicono che si avvicin\u00F2 una donna, era bellissima, alta, occhi verdi, c\u0026#x27;era da chiedersi come fosse finita l. Lui le si avvicin\u00F2 e le disse: Enchant.\r\nClay \u0026quot;Bird\u0026quot; Puller. Morir in un modo bellissimo, diceva Shatzy. Gliel\u0026#x27;ho promesso: morir in un modo bellissimo.","ArtistNames":"Air (Ft.
