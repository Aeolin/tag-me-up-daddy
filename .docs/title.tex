\begin{abstract}
Last.fm contains a huge list of user proposed tags for songs. In this paper we investigate how well a finetuned large language model can perform this task. This would allow to at least semi automate the tagging process for new songs. The tagging can also be used to investigate how well the lyrics of a song convey it's core properties.
