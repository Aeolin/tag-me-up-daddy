devoured its prey\r\nIt would drape the skeletons over its web\r\nIn weeks creating a macabre shrine of remains\r\nIts web was also unique, in that it had many layers\r\nLike floors in a building\r\nAt the top of this palace-like place\r\nAssembled with almost apparent care\r\nWere tiny, shining objects\r\nGlass, beads, dewdrops\r\nOne could almost call it an altar\r\nWhen the breeze blew through this construction\r\nIt produced sounds of wailing, crying\r\nTiny wails, tiny cries\r\nThe baby spiders would get scared\r\nAnd search frantically for their mother\r\nBut the glass spider would have long gone\r\nHaving known that the babies\r\nWould survive somehow on their own\r\nOh, the glass spider had blue eyes almost like a human\u0026#x27;s\r\nThey shed tears at the
