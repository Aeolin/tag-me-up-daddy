banished each of the lovers to opposite sides of the great river, allowing them only to meet once each year: on the seventh day of the seventh month\r\nOn that day, a ferryman carries the shepherd boy

His dimples how merry!\r\nHis cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!\r\nHis droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow\r\nAnd the beard of his chin was as white as the snow\r\nThe stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth\r\nAnd the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath\r\nHe had a broad face and a little round belly\r\nThat shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!\r\nHe was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf\r\nAnd I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!\r\nA wink of his eye and a twist of his head\r\nSoon gave me to know I had nothing to dread\r\nHe spoke not a word, but went straight to his work\r\nAnd filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk\r\nAnd laying his finger aside of his nose\r\nAnd giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!\r\nHe sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle\r\nAnd away they all flew like the down of a thistle\r\nBut I heard him exclaim, \u0026#x27;ere he drove out of sight\r\nHappy christmas to all, and to all a

back and forwards either way\r\n\r\nThere\u0026#x27;s a village for us somewhere in Northern MichiganWith a dirt road leading to a covered bridgeWhere earlier we\u0026#x27;d scurried offTo check the cart the horse had drawnFor fuses and more powder for the Fourth\r\nAnd in the nighttime when the first of them is lit\r\nWe will sneak back there in darkness just to kiss\r\nAnd I\u0026#x27;ll panic at your imageAs the flashes split the rafter gapsTerrified you\u0026#x27;ll see my open eyelids\r\n\r\nAnd this is what I do now every night\r\nTry to somehow catch you in the light\r\n\r\nWhen summer goes the leaves shift tone then float\r\nAs the canopy reverts to branch and bone\r\nDownward tumbling inadvertently\r\nI stumble and you steady me\r\nI twirl you one quick circle, make your ankles show\r\nThen we laugh so hard we can no longer stand\r\nAnd you look me in the eyes and take my hands\r\nOn the forest floor it\u0026#x27;s warmer\r\nThan my bed has ever been before\r\nCurled up

First with brooms, then with dusters; then on ladders and steps and chairs, with a brush and a pail of whitewash; till he had dust in his throat and eyes, and splashes of whitewash all over his black fur. Spring was moving in the air above and in the earth below and around him, penetrating even his dark and lowly little house with its spirit of divine discontent and longing. It was small wonder, then, that he suddenly flung down his brush on the floor, and said, \u2018Bother!\u2019 Something up above was calling him\r\nSo he scraped and scratched and scrabbled and scrooged and then scrooged again and scrabbled and scratched and scraped, working busily with his little paws and muttering to himself, \u2018Up we go! Up we go!\u2019 till at last, pop! His snout came out into the sunlight, and he found himself rolling in the warm grass of a great meadow\r\n\u2018This is fine!\u2019 he said to himself, and, jumping off all his four legs at once, in the joy of living and the delight of spring, he pursued his way across the meadow till he reached the hedge on the further side\r\nHither and thither through the meadows he rambled busily, finding everywhere birds building, flowers budding, leaves thrusting\u2014everything happy, and progressive, and occupied. And instead of having an uneasy conscience pricking him, he somehow could only feel how jolly it was to be the only idle dog among all these busy citizens\r\nHe thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen a river before\u2014this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again. All was a-shake and a-shiver\u2014glints and gleams and sparkles, rustle and swirl, chatter and bubble. The mole was bewitched, entranced, fascinated. By the side of the river he trotted as one trots, when very small, by the side of a man who holds one spell-bound by exciting stories; and when tired at last, he sat on the bank, while the river chattered on to him, a babbling procession of the best stories in the world, sent from the heart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea\r\nThe mole waggled his toes from sheer happiness, spread his chest with a sigh of full contentment, and leaned back blissfully. \u2018WHAT a day I\u2019m having!\u2019 he said","ArtistNames":"La Dispute","HasCompleteLyrics":true,"LastFMTags":["experimental","spoken word"],"GeniusId":726097},{"ArtistId":35981,"PrimaryArtistName":"La Dispute","FeaturedArtists":[],"Title":"B","Lyrics":"","ArtistNames":"La Dispute","HasCompleteLyrics":true,"LastFMTags":["post-hardcore","screamo","experimental","hardcore"],"GeniusId":3137828},{"ArtistId":1581,"PrimaryArtistName":"Linkin Park","FeaturedArtists":[],"Title":"Program (Meteora Demo)","Lyrics":"","ArtistNames":"Linkin Park","HasCompleteLyrics":true,"LastFMTags":["instrumental"],"GeniusId":4198945},{"ArtistId":35981,"PrimaryArtistName":"La Dispute","FeaturedArtists":[],"Title":"Future Wars","Lyrics":"\u0026quot;Crows, wipe the blood off the end of your claws,\u0026quot;\r\nSaid the vulture\r\nLet\u0026#x27;s gather like storms for the war, for the war\r\nAh, crows, as the night turns its skin into coal\r\nDark as corpses but cluttered with gold\r\nThey will label you thieves, wolves, and whores\r\nBut\r\nYou are nothing less than angels\r\nYou are nothing less than angels\r\nYou are nothing less than angels\r\nYou are nothing less than angels\r\n\r\nTo the cast down and covered in black\r\nAin\u0026#x27;t this the bloodiest mess in the world?

San Diego. I\u2019d just come out the other side of a relationship that blew up\u2026I was angry, and disillusioned, and ultimately self-destructive. I\u2019d lost everything I believed in \u2026I was as utterly, completely alone as I\u2019ve ever been\r\n\r\nSo I began going on walks\r\n\r\nI started taking late-night walks around the San Diego suburb I was living in at the time. I\u2019d start walking early evening, and come back close to midnight, sometimes later. Walking and thinking and chewing over what had gone wrong with my life\r\nOne night, at Fourth and E Streets, I got mugged and beaten by a street gang\u2014sent me to the hospital with serious intimations of mortality. When the ER techs asked what my religion was, I refused to answer. I made my private peace with the universe, content with whatever was going to happen, live or die\r\n\r\nThen something happened. I got angry. I got angry because I still had stories to tell. So I fought back\r\n\r\nIt took two months to fully recover. But two things came out of that incident. First, I have no fear of death. None whatsoever\r\n\r\nSecond\u2026as soon as I was well enough, I started walking again\r\n\r\nSometimes until 3 or 4 in the morning, through parts of town that made even street people nervous\r\n\r\nWhen people asked what I was doing out there that late at night, the only answer I could give was, \u201CI\u2019m looking for something.\u201D\r\nSo I kept walking through some of the most dangerous parts of San Diego, before it got cleaned up, when it was still home to hookers and drunks and gangs and addicts and random violence\r\n\r\nFinally, one afternoon, I came to the same areas I walked through at night and I was struck by the dichotomy between that corner at night, and the very same corner during the day\r\n\r\nIn the daylight, there were businessmen and kids and clerks, eager to get home to dinner and TV and family\r\n\r\nThen, later, came the night shift, the lost people, emerging from shadows and beds of pain to walk the same streets in search of fixes, money, and bars, gradually fading away with the dawn\r\n\r\nTwo totally different worlds, sharing nothing but longitude and latitude. There was the nation in the day, and the nation at night, existing side by side but each fleeing the other\r\nA daylight nation\r\n","ArtistNames":"La

They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor\r\nNothing is told us about Sisyphus in the underworld. Myths are made for the imagination. As for this myth, one sees merely the whole effort of a body straining to raise the huge stone, to roll it, and push it up a slope a hundred times over; one sees the face screwed up, the cheek tight against the stone, the wholly human security of two earth-clotted hands. At the very end of his long effort, the purpose is achieved. Then Sisyphus watches the stone rush down in a few moments toward the lower world whence he will have to push it up again toward the summit. He goes back down to the plain\r\nIt is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me. A face that toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see that man going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the torment of which he will never know the end. That hour like a breathing-space which returns as surely as his suffering, that is the hour of consciousness. At each of those moments when he leaves the heights and gradually sinks toward the lairs of the gods, he is superior to his fate. He is stronger than his rock\r\nThe workman of today works everyday in his life at the same tasks, and his fate is no less absurd. But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious. Sisyphus knows the whole extent of his wretched condition: it is what he thinks of during his descent. There is no fate that can not be surmounted by scorn\r\nIf the descent is thus sometimes performed in sorrow, it can also take place in joy. When the images of earth cling too tightly to memory, it happens that melancholy arises in man\u2019s heart: this is the rock\u2019s victory. But crushing truths perish from being acknowledged. Thus, Edipus at the outset obeys fate without knowing it. But from the moment he knows, his tragedy begins. Yet at the same moment, he realizes that the only bond linking him to the world is the cool hand of a girl. Then a tremendous remark rings out: \u201CDespite so many ordeals, my advanced age and the nobility of my soul make me conclude that all is well.\u201D\r\n\u201CI conclude that all is well,\u201D says Edipus, and that remark is sacred. It echoes in the wild and limited universe of man. It teaches that all is not, has not been, exhausted\r\nAll Sisyphus\u2019 silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to him\r\nThe rock is still rolling","ArtistNames":"La Dispute","HasCompleteLyrics":true,"LastFMTags":["spoken
