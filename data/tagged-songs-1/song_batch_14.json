Si alza. Vede all\u0026#x27;orizzonte, minuscole, davanti a s\u00E9, le case bianche del pueblo. Per un attimo si volta indietro. Vede Dark, a un centinaio di metri, in piedi. Fermo. Wister raccoglie le borse e il fucile. Si rimette in marcia, puntando verso il pueblo. Cammina per ore. Ogni tanto cade a terra, si abbassa il cappello sugli occhi, e aspetta. Quando sente le forze tornare, si alza e riparte. Non si volta mai\r\nRiesce ad arrivare al pueblo prima del tramonto. Gli danno da bere e da mangiare. Dice: \u0026quot;Sono lo sceriffo Wister.\u0026quot; Gli danno un letto per dormire. Gli dicono in spagnolo che c\u0026#x27;\u00E8 un chico, fuori dal pueblo. Si \u00E8 accampato qualche centinaio di metri dalle prime case. Gli chiedono se \u00E8 un suo amico. \u0026quot;No,\u0026quot; dice lo sceriffo Wister. La spalla lo fa impazzire. Dorme con una pistola carica, a portata di mano\r\n\r\nIl quinto giorno lo sceriffo Wister si fa dare un cavallo, e parte verso le montagne. Ritrova il vento, e nubi di polvere che cancellano la pista. Cavalca per ore, senza mai fermarsi. Supera le montagne, senza mai voltarsi\r\nQuando arriva in vista di Closingtown \u00E8 sera. Guarda gli alberi piegati dal vento. Accarezza il collo del suo cavallo, lo ferma. Si volta. Vede Dark, a un centinaio di metri, in sella, immobile. \u0026quot;Ragazzo,\u0026quot; dice piano Wister. \u0026quot;Ragazzo.\u0026quot; Poi preme appena i talloni nel ventre del suo  cavallo e senza pi\u00F9 voltarsi indietro, raggiunge Closingtown.\r\n\r\nQuando arriva alle prime case, qualcuno si mette a urlare che \u00E8 tornato lo sceriffo. La gente esce in strada. Lui continua al passo, senza guardare nessuno. Con una mano tiene le redini, con l\u0026#x27;altra stringe una pistola. La gente non osa avvicinarsi, sembra un morto a cavallo, o un pazzo.\r\nLo sceriffo Wister attraversa la citt\u00E0, come un fantasma, poi gira intorno alla prigione e prende il sentiero per il ranch dei Clark. La gente gli va dietro, a piedi. Quasi non osano parlare. Wister arriva al ranch. Scende da cavallo. Blocca le redini sulla palizzata. Va verso la casa, camminando come un ubriaco. Qualcuno gli si avvicina per aiutarlo. Lui gli punta addosso la pistola. Non dice niente, continua a camminare, e arriva alla casa. Davanti alla casa c\u0026#x27;\u00E8 il padre di Benjamin, Eugene Clark. Faccia invecchiata dal vento, capelli grigi. Lo sceriffo Wister si ferma a tre passi da lui. Continua a stringere una pistola nella mano destra. Solleva lo sguardo su Eugene Clark. Poi dice:\r\n\u0026quot;Mi spiace, continuava a urlare, non la voleva smettere. Lui era sempre stato buono con me. Non aveva mai fatto cos\u00EC, prima. Era un bambino buono.\u0026quot;\r\nEugene Clark fa un passo verso di lui. Wister gli punta contro la pistola. Eugene Clark si ferma. Lo sceriffo Wister solleva il cane della sua Colt 45. Dice:\r\n\u0026quot;Non l\u0026#x27;ho seppellito vivo, giuro. Non respirava pi\u00F9, aveva gli occhi rivoltati, e non respirava pi\u00F9.\u0026quot;\r\nPoi si appoggia la pistola sotto il mento, e spara.","ArtistNames":"Air (Ft.

Monta a cavallo, e al passo, lo segue. Si lascia portare dalla bestia. Ogni tanto il caldo e la stanchezza lo fanno addormentare. Dopo tre ore si ferma a una sorgente. Pensa che l\u0026#x27;indiano potrebbe averla avvelenata. Ma riempie le borracce e riparte.\r\n\u0026quot;Non devo lasciarlo arrivare al deserto,\u0026quot; pensa. \u0026quot;Ci moriremo tutt\u0026#x27;e due, l\u00E0 dentro. Devo fermarlo prima,\u0026quot; pensa.\r\nBeve un sorso d\u0026#x27;acquavite. Aspetta che il sole si abbassi ancora un po\u0026#x27;, all\u0026#x27;orizzonte. Poi dice piano: fine del gioco, ragazzo.\u0026quot;. E parte al galoppo. Dark non sembra accorgersene. Continua al passo, senza voltarsi. Forse sta dormendo.\r\n\u0026quot;\u00C8 mio,\u0026quot; pensa lo sceriffo Wister. Trecento metri. Duecento metri. Cento metri. Lo sceriffo Wister estrae la pistola. Cinquanta metri. Dark si volta, ha una pistola a canna lunga in mano, mira e spara. Un colpo.\r\nIl cavallo di Wister scarta sulla destra, poi frana sulle zampe anteriori. La bestia finisce sdraiata su un fianco. Solleva la testa, cerca di rialzarsi. Wister riesce a scivolargli via da sotto. Sente un dolore bruciante alla spalla. Poi sente un secondo colpo entrare nella carne dell\u0026#x27;animale. Alza la testa, si appoggia al corpo del cavallo e spara tre colpi di pistola, uno dopo l\u0026#x27;altro. Il cavallo di Dark si impenna sulle zampe posteriori e ruota su se stesso, scalciando nell\u0026#x27;aria. Lo sceriffo Wister sfila il fucile dalla sella. Dark riprende il controllo del cavallo e parte al galoppo, cercando di scappare. Wister mira e spara due colpi. Gli sembra di vedere Dark piegarsi sul collo dell\u0026#x27;animale. Poi vede il cavallo rompere l\u0026#x27;andatura, sbandare, fare ancora una ventina di metri e franare a terra. Vede il corpo di Dark sbalzato nella polvere.\r\n\u0026quot;Addio ragazzo,\u0026quot; pensa.\r\nCarica il fucile, prende la mira. Dark sta cercando di rialzarsi. Wister spara. Vede uno sbuffo nella polvere, una decina di metri prima del corpo di Bear. \u0026quot;Merda,\u0026quot; dice. Spara ancora. Il proiettile va a morire vicino all\u0026#x27;altro. Dark si alza. Recupera la sua pistola. Con l\u0026#x27;altra mano sgancia le borse dalla sella. Rimane in piedi, lo sguardo su Wister. Un\u0026#x27;ottantina di metri, tra loro. Un tiro di fucile. Qualcosa di pi\u00F9.\r\nLo sceriffo Wister guarda il sole. Pensa che ha ancora molto tempo, prima del buio. La spalla gli fa male, non riesce a muovere il braccio senza sentire una fitta feroce. Allora sgancia le borse dalla sella e se le mette a tracolla sulla spalla buona. Carica il fucile. E si mette a camminare verso Dark. Il ragazzo lo vede, si volta, e si allontana, anche lui camminando, lentamente.\r\nLo sceriffo Wister si immagina la scena, vista dall\u0026#x27;alto, due uomini a strisciare nel nulla, e pensa: \u0026quot;siamo due condannati.\u0026quot;\r\nCamminano per due ore, poi Dark abbandona la pista e piega verso Est. Lo sceriffo Wister si ferma. \u0026quot;\u00C8 pazzo\u0026quot;, pensa. \u0026quot;Si sta infilando nel deserto. \u00C8 pazzo\u0026quot;. Prende il fucile e spara un colpo in aria. Dark si ferma, si volta. Allora Wister lascia cadere le sue borse per terra. Poi getta il suo fucile, spalanca le sue braccia. Dark rimane immobile. Wister gli cammina incontro, lentamente. Dark non si muove. Wister continua a camminare, poi a poco a poco abbassa le braccia e avvicina le mani al calcio delle pistole.\r\nArriva a una cinquantina di metri dall\u0026#x27;indiano. Si ferma. La spalla lo fa impazzire. Sente il cuore pulsargli cos\u00EC forte da fargli male. \u0026quot;Falla finita, ragazzo,\u0026quot; grida. Dark non si muove. \u0026quot;C\u0026#x27;\u00E8 il deserto da quella parte, vuoi morire da stupido?,\u0026quot; grida. Dark fa qualche passo verso di lui. Poi si ferma. Rimangono cos\u00EC, uno di fronte all\u0026#x27;altro, due schizzi neri nel nulla. C\u0026#x27;\u00E8 un silenzio cos\u00EC orribile che lo sceriffo Wister ci sente dentro Benjamin urlare.","ArtistNames":"Air (Ft.
