As a human being: in peace, in sincerity, in commitment, in solidarity. To take a real moment and mourn the tragic loss of these innocent, beautiful people. And let\u0026#x27;s all today pledge an allegiance of love to them, and to their families, who are suffering so deeply. They are sons and daughters, they\u0026#x27;re fathers and mothers, they are all our brothers and our sisters. But tonight I will not allow my anger and outrage over this attack to overshadow our need to honour those who are grieving truly for their lost ones. Lost members of the LGBT community. I hope you know that myself and so many are your allies. Not only me but everyone here, we represent the compassion and the loyalty of millions of people around the world that believe in you, you are not alone. You are not alone.
