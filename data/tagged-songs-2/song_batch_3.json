breaks\r\nBut because of you, Stan, I was out in space\r\nWith the Silver Surfer, that is how I mentally escape\r\nI remember when I found a pencil in the house and drew\r\nDreaming of a day that I could tell a story good as you\r\nAll I knew was pain, and you showed me creativity\r\nAnd made me think about a day that I could have abilities\r\nI could finally protect myself and mom\r\nIf I\u0026#x27;m bulletproof, we wouldn\u0026#x27;t have to run when guns are drawn\r\nBest and worst in people, stories of what\u0026#x27;s right and wrong\r\nAlways fight against the odds, \u0026#x27;cause it\u0026#x27;s dark before the dawn\r\nI looked to what you wrote as a way to live with virtue\r\nProfessor X taught me turn my cheek when others hurt you\r\nIron Man taught me anyone can be a fighter\r\nIf he puts his mind to it, and he never loses fire\r\nThor taught everyone struggles, even gods\r\nAnt Man showed me that size can be a fraud\r\nSpider-Man showed me that life, it isn\u0026#x27;t promised\r\nI wish you didn\u0026#x27;t have to prove that lesson to be honest\r\nToday I got a message from my wife that said you died\r\nAnd I had a bunch of different feelings welling up inside\r\nOn one side I was happy you had led a life\r\nTo be proud of, and you get to be there with your wife\r\nOn the other side I was sad I couldn\u0026#x27;t thank you\r\nFor everything you\u0026#x27;ve done, so I guess that this will makes due\r\nI just want to say, you helped this little kid\r\nHave a childhood, could never pay you back for what you did\r\nLegacy will never die, and I will show my kids\r\nAll your life\u0026#x27;s work, show how it evolved to what it is\r\nSo I\u0026#x27;m here to pay respect, and tell you what you meant to me\r\nExcelsior -
