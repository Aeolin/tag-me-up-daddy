have it removed through official channels resulted in humming and hawing and hand-wringing and ultimately\r\nDead ends\r\nIn 2014, a poll of locals found that 56% of people wanted it to stay\r\nWhen the system for maintaining our shared public spaces fails\r\nAnd a monument to a proud slave trader is allowed to stand in the center of a town, getting older and grander by the year\r\nSinking his rotten roots deeper and deeper into the ground\r\nThe people (I would argue)\r\nHave a right\r\nEven a moral duty\r\nTo tear it down\r\nAnd to roll it without fanfare into the nearest fucking river\r\n\r\nAnd this is exactly what they did\r\nOn June 7th, 2020, against the explicit wishes of the democratically elected council and the majority of the city\r\nThis is not, despite what you may think or may have heard, \u0026quot;a complicated issue\u0026quot;\r\nWhite Britain doesn\u0026#x27;t have the privilege of saying there is a gray area here\r\nNot anymore\r\nWe have been living comfortably in the gray area for hundreds of years\r\nAnd failing to do the bare fucking minimum for the people we have transplanted over here against their will\r\nIt is hard to not feel more than a little cognitive dissonance when your country tells you that racism is a thing of the distant past\r\nWhile a monument to a professional racist stands towering over a major city with his chin resting lazily in his fucking palms\r\n\r\nIt took me way too long to figure out\r\nThat equality and fairness\r\nDo not always equate to treating everybody exactly the same\r\nOr to insisting that groups with competing interests work together to come to a compromise\r\nWhy should a group, whose primary interest is disempowering white supremacists, be forced to compromise with groups whose sole interest seems to be to impede that progress?\r\nI have very little problem, it turns out\r\nWith saying Group A are allowed to take direct, destructive action, while Groups B through KKK are not when

I was losing my entire fucking mind\r\nAnd yeah, when I was falling in love with new people too\r\nGoing entire days without thinking of you\r\nGetting resentful about the pile of your belongings

pretend\r\nThan to express ourselves honestly\r\nThis approach was actively encouraged, for fucks sake\r\nAs if those habits have ever once produced a single happy or healthy individual in the history of our species\r\nIt\u0026#x27;s like trying to fucking shut off a\u2014a garden hose by clamping your thumb over the end\r\nIt seems to work for about half a second\r\nAnd then what had been a steady

A mass shooting in which nine people were killed. July 26, 2016. Two days before there had been an axe attack on a train in Versburg\u2013No casualties. Two days after there would be a machete attack in reutlingen\u2013Two casualties. These events were unusual, both in their nature and in their proximity to one another. They made headline news across the world. You might not remember them, but you almost certainly heard about them at the time. They came at a time when tensions surrounding the refugee crisis were and still are, at the point of recording, hitting a boiling point, not just in Germany\u2013France had suffered a brutal terrorist attack less than two weeks earlier in Nice\u2013eighty-six casualties, and in Paris the previous November\u2013a hundred and thirty casualties, and in Belgium, as well, where an attack on Brussels airport had left, uh, thirty dead in March, and in Greece whose economy was already sinking into the ocean back in 2010. On whose shores thousands of refugees were now landing every day. Back home tensions were just as high, if not higher. Now we hadn\u2019t had an attack since the London bombings in 2005, mind you\u2013fifty-two casualities, but the news was waterboarding us daily with footage of the make shift camp in calleg containing just under seven and a half thousand refugees seeking sanctuary in the U.K. Now compare that number to the number Germany had taken in by some estimates, over 1.1 million, and we, like most islanders I guess, start to look a little hysterical in the face of change and overly concerned with maintaining the sanctity of our personal space. Whether our anxiety was justified or not, our country and the rest of the continent was divided\u2013Between those who felt that there were lessons we had to learn from the fallout of the holocaust and the second world war. That we had nothing short of a moral duty, an obligation to take in as many refugees as we can realistically afford to care for, and on the other side, were those who were worried that having a large group of people entering the country, regardless of their country of origin, would be a strain on our resources, and a threat to our culture, with the added twist that these people were coming from a region that we had been for over half a decade bombing the (lives) out of. Where extremist anti-western sentiment had been coalescing under the flag of a so-called islamic state\u2013A group who were now explicitly stating that they were going to be sending sleeper agents into europe along with the refugees. It was a mess. Nobody knew what was going on, and everybody was watching Germany. To see whether it was worth following their lead. \u201CThere will be blood,\u201D said the continent\u2019s right wing. And then when the Munich attack happened. We on the left, privately, started to wonder if they were right after all. Nobody had any real information, and so the tabloids and the blogs, increasingly indistinguishable from one another, did what tabloids and blogs do best. Syrian asylum seekers, refugee crisis, muslim terrorist attack\u2013th-the human brain is not designed to be a truth detector. It\u2019s designed to respond to stories. The more evocative the better. There is a..There is a gap that was left empty when we outsourced our folk storytelling to Hollywood that the tabloid press has stepped in to fill its place. They take the familiar pieces of our day to day lives: the shopping centers, the airports, the immigrants, the weird unfamiliar religions, and they rearrange these pieces in front of our eyes into terrifying constellations until one of the constellations snags against something dark and amorphous in our subconscious, triggering the release of a potent natural speedball into our system: dopamine, endorphins, adrenaline, keeping us coming back to the same papers and the same websites again and again for more of that feeling because we enjoy being afraid, and we enjoy being afraid because that payload of dopamine, endorphins, adrenaline, is the same bunch of chemicals that is released when we are happy, That\u2019s why a lot of us feel amazing after watching a horror movie. It\u2019s why a mediocre horror movie is, for many of us, more enjoyable than an Oscar-winning drama, and it\u2019s why the horror movie industry is effectively a money printing machine, and it\u2019s the same reason why the mail online is the internet\u2019s most visited english language news provider. You don\u2019t just enjoy hearing stories about monsters, you go looking for them. You do this because your brain thinks it\u2019s learning from them. It\u2019s a particularly ingenious quirk of natural selection, the fact that we can be scared by and alter our behavior in response to abstract fears. This is what has kept us nimble, and vigilante, and alive for tens of thousands of years. The hunter who now really avoids getting eaten by a tiger, who is given a main line dose of pharmaceutical-grade mortal terror, firing up learning synopsis of their brain like watching the burning of Alexandria in reverse. This hunter is unlikely to make the mistakes that almost got him killed more than once, but how do you pass that knowledge on without throwing your children at tigers and hoping they come home? If the hunter is a decent storyteller, able to induce in others even a fraction of that terror, emulate the conditions, replicate the lessons, the people who hear the hunter\u2019s story will be at an evolutionary advantage without needing to see a tiger, but we are not hunters anymore. Not really. The Mail online is not saving anybody\u2013from anything, and I was aware of all this. I knew the games the (they) right wing played. I thought being onto their games meant that I was safe from them, that I could dip in and out of the swamp at will without fear of being infected by it, and I was dipping in and out of it. Regularly. Because I was following the most interesting U.S. election cycle in modern history. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The great unpopularity contest. A nation-wide poll to see who was the least unlikable. Everyday I would wake up, and it would be the first thing I\u2019d google, and Donald Trump had made xenophobia the keystone of his entire campaign, to listen to him speak, meant to open your gates wide open and inviting his memetic trojan horse into your brain. I did this every. Day. This is how people go insane. This is how people forget what is real and what is a smear of on their window pane. On my way home, from germany, I stayed overnight in a hotel in Paris, and I woke in the middle of the night\u2026to the sound of screaming. Gunshots. Commotion. And next to my bed, standing over me, two middle eastern men, with assault rifles, speaking in a language I didn\u2019t understand, and I knew, instantly, as you do in dreams, that a group of terrorists had taken the hotel, and were going room to room executing the western infidels. I knew\u2026but then I woke up, and I took a deep breath. I opened my eyes, and my bedroom was empty. This is the exact moment I realized that the monster stories I\u2019d been laughing at for years..had slipped through the bars of their cage, burrowed through my eyes and ears and had hatched while I was sleeping. They weren\u2019t just on the news and in the papers anymore. They were in my head, emulating the conditions, replicating the lessons. This is how I learned that I am not above being a scared little white man. I am not too smart to fall for all the rhetorician bile. I am not immune to the disease the right wing is deliberately trying to spread. These stories do not deserve our respect, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can be careless around them, and for the rest of my life, whenever I see a brown person wearing a puffy jacket or a rucksack or carrying a sports bag, my heart rate will increase, and my pupils will dilate, and my brain will secrete dopamine, endorphins, and adrenaline into my bloodstream, and sometimes, sometimes I will forget that this is happening because I\u2019m weak. Sometimes..hopefully not too regularly, I will make the stupidest mistake it\u2019s possible to make. I will assume that my fear of something is evidence that that something is worth being afraid of.\r\nYou know the killer behind the Munich terror attack? Was eighteen year old David Sonboly. A secular German born citizen, who was targeting Turks and Arabs because it was Turkish and Arab children who had been bullying him. He idolized Anders Breivik. A norweigen terrorist who killed, among others, fifty-five children who he believed were apart of a global left wing conspiracy. David Sonboly supported Germany\u2019s far-right political party, and he considered himself a proud member of the arian race. I try to remember this\u2026when I have the..well..the-the narcissism. The feel\u2026Unsafe.

brain has to conserve energy somehow, to keep that last spark of them alive for as long as possible and so it jettisons all non-essential functions up to and including the sub-conscious, the ability to dream.\r\nMy wife had been one of the most creatively-driven people I had ever known.\r\nBut that last little piece of her that I\u2019d never be able to reach, never be able to speak to, is now just floating somewhere alone, not even capable of dreaming itself a home.\r\nThere was, though, some forum of hope.\r\nWhoever had known her best who has ever minded, become most entwined with hers over the course of her life could become a donor of sort through a process known as \u201Cdream transfusion\u201D\r\nthrough which someone could create a whole world for their loved one to live in \u2014 thing is\r\nI knew that person, whoever it was, was not me.\r\nHowever much I wanted it to be. But knowing that and accepting that were different things.\r\nThis would be my last opportunity to give something back to the person who had given so much to me; but more importantly my last chance to prove to her that I\u0026#x27;d not been a total fucking waste of her energy.\r\n\r\nAnd so I didn\u0026#x27;t correct the doctors when they assumed that my mind would be a perfect match for hers.\r\nAnd I didn\u0026#x27;t listen when they told me what the risks were.\r\nAnd as I signed the waiver before the dream transfusion, I told myself a story.\r\nAnd the story became the song Papillon.\r\nThat I would build my wife a haven, make her happy and comfortable, weave myself into her eternity so that she would know in a way that I was out there looking after her.\r\nAnd whenever she decided that it was time to go, that it was time to climb into the tiny boat I\u2019d left on her shore and sail out into the unknown then, maybe, maybe I would meet her again in whatever place lies across the water.\r\n\r\nI should have listened when they told me what the risks were.\r\nI tried my damndest to build my wife who It\u0026#x27;d became horrifyingly clear over the last year I barely knew at all, an afterlife that would not be a hell.\r\nBut anyone who knew us during that time would have told you that hell was the only thing we were capable of building together.\r\nThat last little spark of the person I loved stayed burning for less than twenty seconds before snuffing itself out.\r\n","ArtistNames":"The Narcissist Cookbook","HasCompleteLyrics":true,"LastFMTags":["folk punk","alternative","indie rock","uk"],"GeniusId":3833640},{"ArtistId":276,"PrimaryArtistName":"Madonna","FeaturedArtists":[],"Title":"Erotica (Kenlou B-Boy Mix)","Lyrics":"[Intro]\r\nErotica (Erotica, erotica)\r\nErotica (Erotica, erotica)\r\nRomance (romance, romance)\r\n\r\nErotic, erotic\r\nErotic, erotic\r\nErotic, erotic\r\nPut your hands all over my body\r\n\r\n[Verse 1]\r\nIf I take you from behind\r\nPush myself into your mind\r\nWhen you least expect it\r\nWill you try and reject it?\r\nIf I\u0026#x27;m in charge\r\nAnd I treat you like a child\r\nWill you let yourself go wild\r\nLet my mouth go where it wants to?\r\n\r\n[Pre-Chorus]\r\nGive it up, do as I say\r\nGive it up and let me have my way\r\nI\u0026#x27;ll give you love, I\u0026#x27;ll hit you like a truck\r\nI\u0026#x27;ll give you love, I\u0026#x27;ll teach you how to...\r\nI\u0026#x27;d like to put you in a trance\r\nAll over\r\n","ArtistNames":"Madonna","HasCompleteLyrics":true,"LastFMTags":["girlie show"],"GeniusId":6080508},{"ArtistId":276,"PrimaryArtistName":"Madonna","FeaturedArtists":[],"Title":"Die Another Day (Dirty Vegas Main Mix)","Lyrics":"[Verse 1]\r\nI\u0026#x27;m gonna wake up, yes and no\r\nI\u0026#x27;m gonna kiss some part of\r\nI\u0026#x27;m gonna keep this secret\r\nI\u0026#x27;m gonna close my body now\r\n\r\n[Verse 2]\r\nI\u0026#x27;m gonna break the cycle\r\nI\u0026#x27;m gonna shake up the system\r\nI\u0026#x27;m gonna destroy my ego\r\nI\u0026#x27;m gonna close my body now\r\nMy body now\r\nMy body now\r\nMy body now\r\nMy body now\r\n\r\n[Chorus 1]\r\nI guess I\u0026#x27;ll die another day\r\nI guess I\u0026#x27;ll die another day\r\nI guess I\u0026#x27;ll die another day\r\nI guess I\u0026#x27;ll die another day\r\nI guess I\u0026#x27;ll die another day\r\nI guess I\u0026#x27;ll die another day\r\nI guess I\u0026#x27;ll die another day\r\nI guess I\u0026#x27;ll die another day\r\nI guess I\u0026#x27;ll die another day\r\n","ArtistNames":"Madonna","HasCompleteLyrics":true,"LastFMTags":["pop","dance","house","soundtrack"],"GeniusId":3902384},{"ArtistId":276,"PrimaryArtistName":"Madonna","FeaturedArtists":[],"Title":"Across the Sky (Demo)","Lyrics":"[Verse 1: Madonna]\r\nI\u2019m no stranger to deception\r\nI have lied and been lied to (Uh, so have I)\r\nI\u2019m no paragon of virtue\r\nBut I wanna be with you\r\nI have never been a righteous soul\r\nAnd I\u205Fdon\u2019t\u205Fpretend\u205FI am\r\nBut I\u205Fwalk the line\u205Fwhen I\u2019m with you\r\nBecause you make me believe I can\r\n\r\n[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]\r\nBut we\u2019re running out of options\r\nAnd we\u2019re running out of time\r\nAnd I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s you or me\r\nBut it\u2019s time to speak your mind\r\n\r\n[Chorus: Madonna \u0026amp;
