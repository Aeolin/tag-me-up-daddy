question\r\nThere is generally a feeling that something that there\u2019s something happening\r\nPeople have been exposed of course to the whole concept of peak oil, to climate change, to population explosion\r\nThe doomsday clock keeps moving closer\r\nReligious people are talking about the End Times\r\nPresent state of disorganization\r\nWhat seems to be happening is that people are beginning to realise\r\nHow many of these are real crises or how many of these are crises as a result of limitations of our belief system?\r\nWhere civilization\u2019s structures become so rigid and it can no longer adapt to the changing situations\r\nThere\u2019s a great increase in mental illness\r\nThere are signs of when these civilizations come to an end\r\nThere\u2019s a sense of alienation within the population\r\nA very large increase in violent crime, social disruption\r\nSome of the beliefs that we have bought into affect the entire population so\r\nAnd surprisingly an interest in religious cultism\r\nAs societies start to begin to disintegrate\r\nThese weapons of mass distraction which are now falling apart as we\u2019re seeing life being exposed time and time again, every day, every week\r\nWhat they\u2019ve been distracting us from is our true power, the true nature of human nature\r\nOur power to evolve, our power to become cells in the organism called humanity\r\nAnd it\u2019s an exciting story of our own power to evolve our own true nature and our own evolutionary destiny\r\nMedicine started out as a healing art to help others but over time and in our materialistic world and a world based on corporations, industries that thrive by making money off of sick people\r\nBut the environment\u2019s changing\r\nWe are at this very moment in a stage where corporations are teeter-tottering because they can\u2019t maintain themselves anymore\r\nThey\u2019ve grown too big and they have too little awareness to maintain this world\r\nAnd while they\u2019re doing their destruction of the planet, a new series\r\nPeople are coming out of the old just like we talked about\r\nThe imaginal cells\r\nBut imaginal cells have a different vision of the world\r\nAnd why this is important for us is because it is a world of relationship\r\nNobody can get off the bus, we\u2019re all in this together\r\nWe see that we are indeed really approaching a change of civilization\r\nIt really is a lesson for us\r\nWe\u2019re in the throes of a new evolution, a new civilization is manifesting\r\nCreative minorities arise\r\nThe imaginal cells are people that are saying \u201Cthere\u2019s another way to do this\u201D\r\nThere\u2019s a better brighter image that\u2019s much more successful than the one we\u2019re doing\r\nThey\u2019re precursors of the next level of our evolution\r\nThe fractal image will repeat itself, it\u2019s not a coincidence\r\nWe know where we\u2019ve been, we know we\u2019re going\r\nAnd all I have to say is just stay out of the way of the dinosaurs as they crash\r\nAnd allow us to take over this planet and bring in the new ideas that the imaginal cells will offer\r\nTo support and encourage our survival as a civilization on
