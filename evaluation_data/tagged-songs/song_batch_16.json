my phone number on the internet to talk to fans\r\nBut he called, cause he felt like nobody understands\r\nAll his father does is drink, and his momma\u0026#x27;s in the streets\r\nAnd sometimes when comes home, there\u0026#x27;s just nothing left to eat\r\nAnd he hates it\r\nTold me that he hates his life, he\u0026#x27;s thinking he should take it\r\nSelecting all the hurt and just erase it\r\nSo I talk to him everyday, same time every night\r\nGet to know his name, where he stay, you know, what he like\r\nAnd even though I found his life really kind of rough\r\nHe was smart to computers and that kind of stuff\r\nAnd one day my phone died and I was kind of scared\r\nThinking he would trip out, but when I called him he was there\r\nThat\u0026#x27;s my lil homie\r\nHe looked up to me, called me his OG\r\nHe heard all my songs way before the world did\r\nAnd next thing you know, he got a little girlfriend\r\nHis grades started going up, but his momma\u0026#x27;s health didn\u0026#x27;t\r\nSo when she passed away, he said he ain\u0026#x27;t really miss her\r\nSaid she hit the road, left him and his little sister\r\nAnd that\u0026#x27;s when they were young, so he ain\u0026#x27;t get to bond with her\r\nI understand\r\nWas kind of cool to watch him grow up to a man\r\nAnd I started feeling proud\r\nAnd I know I\u0026#x27;m not his dad\r\nBut if you know me, you know I write songs and make tracks\r\nAin\u0026#x27;t really got time for no or all that\r\nSo through this whole thing I learned the craziest lesson\r\nThat this kid was actually my unexpected blessing\r\nSpoke to him last week, he said I\u0026#x27;m all good nowCheck my profile, turned my picture upside down\r\nAnd well, thanks
