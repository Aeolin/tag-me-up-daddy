But truthfully, when I\u0026#x27;m in the middle of making a record - especially now, when the world is in the middle of such a tumultuous period - I find I really need to take the space for myself, far away from real life to consider what my contribution to the world should be in these dark times\r\n\r\nSo each morning I have the luxury of asking myself, \u0026quot;What shall I cook up for the kids today? Something with a little spice? Something with a little bitterness but is ultimately sweet? Or shall I take the day off and turn down the fire, and just take a moment to send my love to them over the ether?\u0026quot; Because sometimes just being pure of heart, and having good intentions, and letting them be known is the most worthy contribution an artist can make\r\n\r\nSo, even though these times can feel a little bit crazy, they\u0026#x27;re not so very different from what other generations have experienced at one time or another before. Amidst all the uncertainty, and as we transition out of one era into another one, there\u0026#x27;s no place I\u0026#x27;d rather be than smack-dab in the middle of \u0026#x27;Hollyweird\u0026#x27; making this record for you.
