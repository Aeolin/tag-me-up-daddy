But of course, that does not mean consciousness in the sense of our ordinary everyday consciousness. Ordinary everyday consciousness is indeed a form of this kind of consciousness\u2014shall we say, a manifestation of it?\u2014but then there\u2019s also consciousness which doesn\u2019t notice, but nevertheless is highly responsive. The way your heart beats, the way you breathe, the way you grow your hair: you\u2019re doing it, but you don\u2019t know how it\u2019s done.\r\n\r\nSo therefore, just in the same way that conscious attention is not aware of all the other operations of the body, so in just that way we are not aware of our connection\u2014indeed, our identity\u2014with the fundamental Self. When the leaves die and fall off the trees, or the fruit drops\u2014next year: more leaves, more fruit. So, in the same way, when you and I die: more babies later. If the whole human race dies, you bet your life there are all kinds of things that feel that they\u2019re human scattered throughout the multiplicity of galaxies. Because this universe is a peopling universe, just as an apple tree apples. But because we are unconscious of the intervals we are not aware of the Self with our conscious attention when conscious attention isn\u2019t operating. But still, just as you don\u2019t notice what your pineal gland, say, is doing at the moment, so in the same way you don\u2019t notice the connections which tie us all together\u2014not only here and now, but forever and ever and ever and ever.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty, the basic reason why we don\u2019t notice the Self, is that the Self doesn\u2019t need to look at itself. A knife doesn\u2019t need to cut itself. Fire doesn\u2019t need to burn itself. Water doesn\u2019t need to quench itself, and a light doesn\u2019t need to shine on itself. So this is the fundamental problem of having some sort of awareness of the self. Nevertheless, it is the whole contention of Indian philosophy, especially what we call Ved\u0101nta, that it is possible\u2014in a certain way\u2014to become aware of oneself in this deepest sense; to know that you are the totality.\r\n\r\nAnd this experience is the real substance of Indian philosophy as a whole, both Hindu and Buddhist. It is called mok\u1E63a, which roughly means \u2018liberation.\u2019 Liberation from the hallucination that you are just poor little me. To wake up from that kind of hypnosis and discover that you are simply something\u2014your organism, your physical body, your conscious attention (which is your ego)\u2014that you are something being done by this vast, indescribable Self, which is out of time, which has no beginning, no end, it neither continues nor discontinues. It\u2019s beyond all categorization whatsoever, and so the Upanishads say, all we can say of it positively is the negative. Neti neti; \u2018it is not this, not that.\u2019 Anything, therefore, you can formulate\u2014imagine, picture\u2014will not be the Self.\r\n\r\nSo when you are trying to know the Self you have to get rid of every idea in your head. It doesn\u2019t mean, as some people seem to think, that you have to get rid of every sense-impression. It isn\u2019t as if you had to go into a catatonic state of total absorption. Of course that can be done, but the full mok\u1E63a\u2014the full liberation\u2014is when you come back out of absorption and see this everyday world just as it looks now, but see as clearly as clearly can be that it is all the Self. You can become aware of this tremendous interconnectedness of everything, and that is what somebody who is mok\u1E63a\u2014who is liberated\u2014sees. He sees, shall we say, that everything goes together.\r\n\r\nAnd that is, in a way, what we mean by \u2018relativity.\u2019 Because relativity means \u2018relatedness,\u2019 just as fronts go with backs and tops with bottoms, insides with outsides, solids with spaces. So everything that there is goes together. And it makes no difference whether it lasts a long time or whether it lasts a short time. A galaxy goes together with all the universe just as much as a mosquito, which has a very short life. From the standpoint of the Self, time is completely relative. You can have, if you scale it down, as much time between two of those very rapid drumbeats as you can in eons and eons and eons, and it\u2019s all a question of point of view. Or\u2014to use a scientific expression\u2014level of magnification.\r\n\r\nChange your magnification and you see molecules. And we know by other methods of observation that it can get smaller and smaller and smaller, and that the spaces between these minute units are so vast that they\u2019re comparable to the distances between the sun and the planets, in scale. So, also, with time. So, in this sense, there could be vast, vast universes full of empires, and battleships, and palaces, and brothels, and restaurants, and orchestras in the tip of your fingernail. And, on the other hand, we could be all going on in the tip of somebody else\u2019s fingernail.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s very important to understand not only the relativity of size and of time, but also of what there is. Now, as you know, the human senses respond only to a very small band of the known spectrum of vibrations. We know, through instruments, of quite a vast spectrum, but we\u2014as I say, with our senses\u2014see only a little of it. If our senses were in some way altered we would see a rather different looking world We can do this, of course\u2014we can put on special lenses to enable us to see heat, and then we see all the heat radiations coming out of people. And we say, Well, I never noticed that about you before! But so, in the same way, you see, there are infinitely many possibilities of vibration, and of organs sensitive to those vibrations, so that there could be world within worlds within worlds, spaces within spaces, just like the many, many wavelengths of radio and television going on forever and ever in all directions. The possibilities are infinite.\r\n\r\nBut having senses and noticing is a selective process. It picks out only certain ones, just as when you play the piano. You don\u2019t take both arms and slam down all keys at once, you select. And so perception is a kind of piano-playing; it is picking out certain things as significant\u2014that is to say, as constituting patterns. And the whole universe seems to be a process of playing with different patterns. But whatever it does, whatever it plays, in whatever dimension, on whatever scale of time or space, it\u2019s all on the Self.","ArtistNames":"Alan

The problem to which the Buddha primarily addressed himself, which is that of agony; suffering. But before we get into that, we have to be clear about certain basics. And these basics have to do not so much with concepts and ideas, as they do with the state of mind. You can call it also a state of feeling, a state of sensation, a state of consciousness. And we need to understand that\u2014even be in that\u2014before we can really go very far. And this is an extraordinarily difficult state of mind to talk about, even though in its nature it\u2019s extremely simple. Because it is, in a way, like we were when we were babies. When we haven\u2019t been told anything and didn\u2019t know anything other than what we felt, and we had no names for it. Now, of course, as we grow older, we learn to differentiate one thing from another, one event from another, and above all, ourselves from everything else. Well and good, provided you don\u2019t lose the foundations.\r\n\t\r\nJust as mountains are differentiated, but they\u2019re all based on the Earth, so the multiple things of this world are differentiated, but they have, as it were, a basis. There is no word for that basis\u2014not really\u2014because words are only for distinctions. And so there can\u2019t really be a word, not even an idea, of the non-distinction. We can feel it, but we can\u2019t think it. But we don\u2019t feel it like an object. You feel you\u2019re alive, you feel you are conscious, but you don\u2019t know what consciousness is because consciousness is present in every conceivable kind of experience. It\u2019s like the space in which we live, which is everywhere. It\u2019s like a fish being in water, and presumably a fish doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s in the water because it never goes out. A bird presumably knows nothing of the air. And we really know nothing of consciousness, and we pretend space isn\u2019t there.\r\n\t\r\nSo, however, when you grow up and become fascinated\u2014which is really the right word; spellbound, enchanted\u2014by all the things that adults wave at you, you forget the background. And you come to think that all the distinctions which you\u2019ve been learning are the supremely important things to be concerned with. You become hypnotized, just in the same way as when the beak of a chicken is put to a chalk line, it gets stuck on that line. And so when we are told to pay attention to what matters, we get stuck with it. And that\u2019s what, in Buddhism, is called attachment.\r\n\t\r\nAttachment doesn\u2019t mean that you enjoy your dinner, or that you enjoy sleeping, or beauty. Those are responses of our organism in its environment as natural as feeling hot near a fire or cold near ice. So are certain responses of fear, or of sorrow. They are not attachment. Attachment is exactly translated by the modern slang term hang-up. It\u2019s a kind of stickiness, or what in psychology would be called blocking. When you are in a state of wobbly hesitation, not knowing how to flow on, that\u2019s attachment; what is meant by the Sanskrit word kle\u015Ba.\r\n\t\r\nSo when the chicken has its beak put to the chalk line, it\u2019s got a hang-up; it\u2019s stuck on that line. And so, in the same way, we get a hang-up on all the various things we are told as we grow up: by our parents, our aunts and uncles, our teachers, and above all, by our peer group. And the first thing that everybody wants to tell us is the difference between ourselves and the rest of the world. And between those actions which are voluntary and those which are involuntary; what we do on the one hand and what happens to us on the other. And this is, of course, immensely confusing to a small child, because it\u2019s told to do all sorts of things that are really supposed to happen, like going to sleep, like having bowel movements, like loving people, like not blushing, stopping being anxious, and all sorts of things like that.\r\n\r\nSo what happens is this: the child is told, in sum, that we\u2014your parents, elders, and betters\u2014command you to do what will please us only if you do it spontaneously. And no wonder everybody is completely confused! We go through life with that burden on us.","ArtistNames":"Alan Watts","HasCompleteLyrics":true,"LastFMTags":["spoken

And this word, in Sanskrit, is \u0100tman, and that means \u2018Self\u2019 in the vastest possible sense, and the most inclusive sense of the word. It means \u2018yourself,\u2019 and it means also \u2018self as such,\u2019 \u2018existence as such,\u2019 the \u2018totality of all being.\u2019 And, of course, this is something that one cannot talk about in the sense of talking about it logically. You can\u2019t talk about it. A poet can talk about anything, and the Upanishads are, very largely, poetry.\r\n\r\nOf course, everything in the world\u2014knives and forks, tables and chairs, trees and stones\u2014are indescribable. Korzybski referred to the physical world as the \u2018unspeakable world,\u2019 which was really rather a funny name because it has two edges. It\u2019s, of course, something you can\u2019t say anything about\u2014that is to say, it is ineffable\u2014but it\u2019s unspeakable also in the sense of the word meaning something taboo. And we shall see, as we go on, wherein that taboo consists.\r\n\r\nBut from the standpoint of logic we can\u2019t say anything about everything, because in order to say something about something, and state it logically, you have to be able to put it in a class. Now, classes are intellectual boxes. When you play games like Animal, Vegetable, Mineral? you\u2019ve got there three boxes. And when you come to think of it, you don\u2019t know any one without another, because in order to have a box there must be what\u2019s inside the box and what\u2019s outside the box. And then, by this method of contrast, we can make a logical discussion about things. All words, therefore, are labels on intellectual pigeonholes.\r\n\r\nBut then, when you come to what fundamentally is, then you\u2019re without a box and you can\u2019t talk logically. Of course, you can distinguish \u2018is\u2019 from \u2018is not,\u2019 but only in a very limited way\u2014as I can say, I have a pen in my left hand. I do not have a pen in my right hand. And from this we abstract the idea of \u2018to be\u2019 and \u2018not to be,\u2019 \u2018is\u2019 and \u2018isn\u2019t.\u2019\r\n\r\nBut when we consider Being\u2014with a capital \u2018B\u2019\u2014this includes not only such \u2018is\u2019es as celestial bodies, but also such \u2018isn\u2019t\u2019s as the space that encompasses them. And these two go together, as we shall see in more detail as the time goes on.\r\n\r\nBut now, a perfectly logical person would therefore say that the notion of the Self\u2014the \u0100tman, as the fundamental reality in which everything else exists\u2014is meaningless. And, of course, from a logical point of view it is. But at the same time, just because something cannot be put into a logical category does not indicate that it isn\u2019t real. The Self, you see, bears somewhat the same relationship to the world as the diaphragm of the speaker in this radio bears to the music you\u2019ve just been hearing. None of the music was about the diaphragm and nobody said anything about there being a diaphragm. The diaphragm, as such, didn\u2019t come into the picture, and yet it was everything in the picture. All those different noises were vibrations of this thin film of metal. So, also, with your eardrum. So, also, with the apparatus of your eyes.\r\n\r\nSo one might ask, then\u2014just as you say, Well, what is it on? What is the music on? Is it on tape, is it on a speaker, is it on a drum? Whatever the variations may be, we can ask the question, What are you all on? What is all this on? And the Hindus answer, It\u2019s on the Self\u2014like we say, This one\u2019s on me. It isn\u2019t that there\u2019s only one Self in the sense that is taught in a philosophy called solipsism. Solipsism is the idea that you are the only person who exists and everybody else is your dream. Nobody can prove that this isn\u2019t so, except I\u2019d like to see a congress of solipsists arguing as to which one of them is really there.\r\n\r\nIt isn\u2019t that; it\u2019s more complex than that. It\u2019s saying that the Self in each one of you is really, at root, one. Just in the same way that you have, all over your body, millions of nerve ends. Each one of those nerve ends is, as it were, a little eye\u2014because all the senses are, fundamentally, one sense; they are various forms of touch. And the most delicate of the forms of touch is, of course, the human eye. Then the ear, and so on, down the list of the senses. Now imagine, then, every little nerve end is a little eye\u2014and it gets its impression of the world, but it sends it all back into the central brain. Well, in a somewhat similar way, every person, every animal, every\u2014what the Hindus call\u2014sentient being; and even rocks are regarded as sentient beings in a very, very primitive form, right down to the lowest.\r\n\r\nSo all those forms that we see may be looked upon as the eyes that look out of one central Self. Only, of course, in the body\u2014in the human body\u2014we can see the connections between the nerve ends and the brain. It\u2019s much more difficult to see the connection between one individual and another. If they\u2019re married that\u2019s a little bit closer. But just all us human beings rattling around, we\u2019re not even rooted to the ground\u2014like trees\u2014and therefore it\u2019s very easy for us to form the impression that I am only what is inside my bag of skin, and that my Self is a different Self from your Self. And we\u2019re all, therefore, fundamentally disconnected. And so your apparent disconnection\u2014the fact that you are not tied to other people with umbilical cords, or some kind of wiring that gives you one mind\u2014nevertheless, we do have one mind. In the sense that, for example, all of us turn out to be approximately the same shape. Two eyes, two nostrils, a mouth, two hands, two legs, and so on.\r\n\r\nA haiku poem\u2014Japanese haiku\u2014says, A hundred gourds from the mind of one vine.

We say, \u201CYou play the piano.\u201D You don\u2019t work the piano.\r\nWhy?\r\nMusic differs from say travel, when you travel you are trying to get somewhere. And of course we, because being a very compulsive and purposeful culture, are busy getting everywhere faster and faster and faster; until we eliminate the distance between plac\u0435s. I mean, with modern jet trav\u0435l you can arrive almost instantaneously. What happens as a result of that is that the two ends of your journey becomes the same place. So you eliminate the distance and you eliminate the journey, but the fun of the journey is to travel, not to obliterate the travel.\r\n\r\nSo then, in music, though, one doesn\u2019t make the end of the composition, the point of the composition.\r\nIf that was so the best conductors would be those who play fastest, and there would be composers who wrote only finales! People would go to concerts just to hear one crashing chord, because that\u2019s the end! Same with dancing. You don\u2019t aim at a particular spot in the room, that\u2019s where you should arrive, the whole point of dancing is the dance.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, but we don\u2019t see that as something brought by our education into our every day conduct. We\u2019ve got a system of schooling that gives a completely different impression. It\u2019s all graded. And what we do is we put the child into the corridor of this grade system with a kind of \u201Ccome on kitty kitty kitty\u201D, and now you go to kindergarten. And that\u2019s a great thing because when you finish that you get into first grade, and then come on; first grade leads to second grade and so on, and then you get out of grade school. Now you\u2019re going to go to high school, and it\u2019s revving up \u2013 the thing is coming. Then you\u2019ve got to go to college, and by Jove then you get into graduate school and when you\u2019re through with graduate school you go out and join the World!\r\n\r\nAnd then you get into some racket where you\u2019re selling insurance. And they\u2019ve got that quota to make, and you\u2019re gonna make that. And all the time that thing is coming. It\u2019s coming, it\u2019s coming! That great thing, the success you\u2019re working for. Then when you wake up one day at about 40 years old you say \u201CMy God! I\u2019ve arrived! I\u2019m there\u201D. And you don\u2019t feel very different from what you\u2019ve always felt. And there\u2019s a slight let down because you feel there\u2019s a hoax. And there was a hoax. A dreadful hoax. They made you miss everything.\r\n\r\nBy expectation, look at the people who live to retire, put those savings away; and then when they\u2019re 65 they don\u2019t have any energy left, more or less impotent; they go and rot in an old people\u2019s senior citizen\u2019s community. Because we\u2019ve simply simply cheated ourselves the whole way down the line.\r\n\r\nWe thought of life by analogy, with a journey, with a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end; and the thing was to get to that end, success or maybe heaven after you\u2019re dead.\r\nBut, we missed the point the whole way along, it was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.\r\nWell then, this is as I\u0026#x27;ve said my basic metaphysical assumption which I am conceive upon you\r\n\r\nThat existence is musical in nature.\r\nThat is to say that it is not serious, it is the play of all kinds of patterns.","ArtistNames":"Alan Watts","HasCompleteLyrics":true,"LastFMTags":["spoken word","philosophy","buddhism","buddhist","psychedelic"],"GeniusId":6553509},{"ArtistId":394321,"PrimaryArtistName":"Alessia Cara","FeaturedArtists":[],"Title":"I Miss You, Don\u0027t Call Me by\u00A0Alessia\u00A0Cara","Lyrics":"[Verse 1]\r\nYou played, I came to visit\r\nYou look the same, but different\r\nMade me so damn sad and so I had to lie\r\nI\u0026#x27;m tryna keep a distance\r\nBut all my motor instincts\r\nStill know their way around\r\nAnd every sound\u2019s amplified\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nAnd the heart beats there\r\nAnd we can\u0026#x27;t hide it, oh, no, no\r\nBut I\u0026#x27;m too scared\r\nTo breathe air into it, I might revive it, oh\r\nOh, I miss you, don\u2019t call me\r\nOh, I miss you, don\u0026#x27;t call me\r\nIf I get too ahead of myself\r\nI can tell I won\u0026#x27;t stop me\r\nI miss you, don\u0026#x27;t call me\r\n\r\n[Post-Chorus]\r\nCall me, don\u0026#x27;t call me\r\nDon\u0026#x27;t call me, please don\u0026#x27;t\r\n\r\n[Verse 2]\r\nI think of things to say so\r\nI never have to go home\r\nDo you remember the last time we were this close?\r\nYou said that everything would be alright\r\n","ArtistNames":"Alessia Cara","HasCompleteLyrics":true,"LastFMTags":["pop","soul","rnb","canadian","female vocalists"],"GeniusId":7196406},{"ArtistId":533,"PrimaryArtistName":"Aerosmith","FeaturedArtists":[],"Title":"Sick as a Dog by\u00A0Aerosmith","Lyrics":"[Verse 1]\r\nPlease, I just got to talk to you\r\nPlease, a get you your head out of the loo\r\nPlease, we\u0026#x27;re a long, long way from home\r\nPlease, you\u0026#x27;d turn a young man\u0026#x27;s face to stone\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nSick as a dog, what\u0026#x27;s your story\r\nSick as a dog, a cat got your tongue\r\nSick as a dog, you\u0026#x27;ll be sorry\r\nSick as a dog, you really ain\u0026#x27;t that young\r\n\r\n[Verse 2]\r\nPlease, you were much to my surprise\r\nPlease, you\u0026#x27;re the lady in disguise\r\nPlease, you\u0026#x27;re the only a friend I got\r\nPlease, you\u0026#x27;ll be the last to see me rot\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nSick as a dog, what\u0026#x27;s your story\r\nSick as a dog, cat got your tongue\r\nSick as a dog, you\u0026#x27;ll be sorry\r\nSick as a dog, because you really ain\u0026#x27;t that young\r\n\r\n[Verse 3]\r\nPlease, it\u0026#x27;s a shame you\u0026#x27;re so refined\r\nPlease, you was the last thing on my mind\r\nPlease, don\u0026#x27;t be late to take it light\r\nPlease, you\u0026#x27;re gonna fade into the night\r\n","ArtistNames":"Aerosmith","HasCompleteLyrics":true,"LastFMTags":["hard rock","rock","classic rock","american artist"],"GeniusId":319050},{"ArtistId":157,"PrimaryArtistName":"Akon","FeaturedArtists":[1282],"Title":"Locked Up (French Remix) by\u00A0Akon (Ft.\u00A0Booba)","Lyrics":"[Verse 1: Booba]\r\nJ\u0026#x27;me suis fait coffrer comme un naze, en gard\u0026#x27;av\u0026#x27;

Briefly, the thesis is that the prevalent sensation of oneself as a separate ego enclosed in a bag of skin is a hallucination which accords neither with Western science nor with the experimental philosophy-religions of the East\u2014in particular the central and germinal Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism. This hallucination underlies the misuse of t\u0435chnology for the violent subjugation of man\u0026#x27;s natural environm\u0435nt and, consequently, its eventual destruction. We are therefore in urgent need of a sense of our own existence which is in accord with the physical facts and which overcomes our feeling of alienation from the universe. For this purpose I have drawn on the insights of Vedanta, stating them, however, in a completely modern and Western style\u2014so that this volume makes no attempt to be a textbook on or introduction to Vedanta in the ordinary sense. It is rather a cross-fertilization of Western science with an Eastern intuition. Particular thanks are due to my wife, Mary Jane, for her careful editorial work and her comments on the manuscript. Gratitude is also due to the Bollingen Foundation for its support of a project which included the writing of this book.\r\n\r\nAlan Watts\r\n","ArtistNames":"Alan Watts","HasCompleteLyrics":true,"LastFMTags":["spoken word","philosophy","buddhism","buddhist","psychedelic"],"GeniusId":6364080},{"ArtistId":394321,"PrimaryArtistName":"Alessia Cara","FeaturedArtists":[1454478],"Title":"Middle Ground by\u00A0Alessia\u00A0Cara (Ft.\u00A0CHIKA)","Lyrics":"[Intro: Alessia Cara]\r\nMm, mm\r\nMm, mm\r\n\r\n[Verse 1: Alessia Cara]\r\nI don\u0026#x27;t like boys, but I do\r\nI just hate it when they make me cry\r\nI got barbwire around my houseBut if someone would trade it for a picket fence I wouldn\u0026#x27;t mindDon\u0026#x27;t come near me, yeahBut don\u0026#x27;t leave me alone\r\nI got my dog and she\u0026#x27;s enough\r\nBut it\u0026#x27;d be nice to hear a voice that\u0026#x27;s not my own\r\n\r\n[Pre-Chorus: Alessia Cara]\r\nAnd I could use a hug sometimes\r\nA little bit of love sometimes\r\nMy bed\u0026#x27;s a little cold on the left side\r\nBut it\u0026#x27;s warm enough sometim\u0435s\r\n\r\n[Chorus: Alessia Cara]\r\nI don\u0026#x27;t know what I want\r\nWould I be better off\r\nAlon\u0435 or with someone?\r\nDrivin\u0026#x27; me crazy (Oh)\r\nI don\u0026#x27;t know what I want\r\nTo give in or give up\r\nThis middle ground I\u0026#x27;m on\r\nIs drivin\u0026#x27; me crazy, crazy\r\n","ArtistNames":"Alessia Cara (Ft.
